# 📊 AWS Analytics Simulation: Root Cause Analysis of Exam Registrations

This project simulates the use of AWS-style analytics to perform root cause analysis on student exam registration failures—similar to tasks handled by the College Board's Exam Config team. It demonstrates how to use Python, SQL-style querying, and static visualization techniques to generate insights from operational data.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

- ✅ Generate a synthetic dataset of 1,000 exam registrations
- ✅ Simulate AWS querying (Athena/Redshift) using SQLite
- ✅ Perform root cause analysis on failed registrations
- ✅ Visualize insights with a static Plotly bar chart (nbviewer-compatible)
- ✅ Export data for simulated S3 integration

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- SQLite3 (for SQL-style analytics)
- Plotly (static visualization via Kaleido)
- Google Colab (development environment)
- GitHub + nbviewer (rendered notebook sharing)
